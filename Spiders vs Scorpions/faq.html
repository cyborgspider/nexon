    <p class="question">1. When does Spiders vs Scorpions start?</p>
    <p class="answer">The first day of the war will be June 15.</p>
    <p class="question">2. When do I choose my team?</p>
    <p class="answer">You can choose your team from the website between May 23 and June 13. If you do not choose during this time, you can choose in-game once Spiders vs Scorpions start.</p>
    <p class="question">3. How do I sign up for a team?</p>
    <p class="answer">Log into your Nexon account and choose a side. If you do not have a Nexon account, click on the "Choose a Side" button first and then create an account.<br />
    You must have a character in the game by June 13 to actually be assigned to the team of your choice and collect prizes.</p>
    <p class="question">4. Why am I signing up for a team now?</p>
    <p class="answer">If you sign up now, you are guaranteed to be on the team you've selected when the Spiders vs Scorpions war begins. You'll also receive the following prizes: 1 Supply Case GP-Regular, 1 Supply GP-Hazard, and 1 Supply Case Gift-N (7-day).</p>
    <p class="question">5. When do I get the prizes?</p>
    <p class="answer">You will receive your 1 Supply Case GP-Hazard and 1 Supply Case Gift-N on June 14th when you log into the game. The date you receive your 1 Supply Case GP-Regular will vary depending on the day you sign up AND have an in-game character. You can see the full reward schedule below.</p>

    <p class="question">6. If I sign up during week 1 but do not create a character until week 2 or 3, do I still get the prizes?</p>
    <p class="answer">You will still receive your 1 Supply Case GP-Hazard and 1 Supply Gift-N on June 14. You will receive your GP-Regular on the reward date of the week you create your character. For example, if you choose a team on May 23 but create a character on June 5, you will receive your Gift-N on June 7.</p>
    <p class="question">7. I was not able to choose the team I wanted. Why? What do I do now?</p>
    <p class="answer">There are only 50,000 slots available per team per week. If you are not able to choose the team you like because that team's already full, come back at the start of the next event week. If you are not able to choose the team you like by the end of all three weeks, don't worry! You will still get a chance to choose your team in-game when Spiders vs Scorpions begins, but you won't receive any prizes this way.</p>
    <p class="question">8. Can I change my team?</p>
    <p class="answer">Nope. Your choice is permanent for this event, so choose wisely!</p>
